h1. Quick Setup (for development)

This requires the 'sqlite3-ruby' gem.

<pre>
wget http://github.com/jcxplorer/hhlc/tarball/0.5.5 #Download the stable release
tar -xvf jcxplorer-hhlc-[SHA1].tar.gz #Unpack the tarball
mv jcxplorer-hhlc-[SHA1] hhlc #Rename the resulting folder to something sane
cd hhlc
sudo rake gems:install #Attempt to install the required gems
rake eish:setup #Perform the initial setup
</pre>

If you like to live on the edge, you can perform these steps on a cloned copy of the repository too:

<pre>
# Just replace the first three steps with:
git clone git://github.com/jcxplorer/hhlc.git
</pre>

h1. Search

Search support is currently experimental.

Search is provided through the "Xapian":http://www.xapian.org/ Open Source Search Engine Library and the "Xapit":http://github.com/ryanb/xapit/ Rails gem.  In order for the Search to work you MUST have xapian-core and xapian-bindings (only the Ruby bindings are required) installed.

For more information on installing Xapian, see the "Xapian install guide":http://www.xapian.org/docs/install.html.

At the moment reindexing must be performed manually, for example by a cron job, using the following command:

<pre>
rake xapit:index
</pre>

However, this requires that the application be restarted for it to read the new database. We now also include the xapit-sync plugin which enables the search index to be updated automatically after changes are made, but it is still far from perfect.

In order to enable search you must uncomment the line for Xapit in environment.rb and change SEARCH_ENABLED to true in the settings.rb initializer.
