h1. Project Status

The project is still under heavy development and is lacking most of its features. Not recommended for any use besides development.

h2. Releases

At the moment we officially have two releases numbered 0.1 and 0.2, but they are no less buggy than the working tree.  Really, we mean it; we only created them for our internal organization of the project.  *Always download the working tree* until we have a stable release.

* "bundle-fu":http://code.google.com/p/bundle-fu/
* "MetaTags":http://github.com/kpumuk/meta-tags/

The *bundle-fu* plugin combines bundles separate CSS and JS files in to single files for faster transfer from server to client.  It was created by Timothy Harper.  We are using the fork by "zinf":http://github.com/zinf/bundle-fu/tree/master.

The *MetaTags* plugin is an SEO plugin by Dmytro Shteflyuk which makes it easier to set the page title and meta tags.
