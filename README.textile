h2. Releases

At the moment we officially have two releases numbered 0.1 and 0.2, but they are no less buggy than the working tree.  Really, we mean it; we only created them for our internal organization of the project.  *Always download the working tree* until we have a stable release.

h1. Initial Setup

* Clone the git repository to a local directory, and clone the bundle-fu plugin.  To do this, execute the following four commands in a terminal.

<pre>
	git clone git://github.com/jcxplorer/hhlc.git

	cd hhlc

	git submodule init

	git submodule update
</pre>

* Create the config/database.yml

E.g.
<pre>
development:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: db/development.sqlite3
    pool: 5
    timeout: 5000
</pre>

* Run 'rake setup' in the local directory

* Run 'rake db:populate' to add test data to the database (optional)

h1. Search

Search support is currently experimental.

Search is provided through the "Xapian":http://www.xapian.org/ Open Source Search Engine Library and the "Xapit":http://github.com/ryanb/xapit/ Rails plugin.  In order for the Search to work you MUST have xapian-core and xapian-bindings (only the Ruby bindings are required) installed.

For more information on installing Xapian, see the "Xapian install guide":http://www.xapian.org/docs/install.html.

At the moment reindexing must be performed manually, for example by a cron job, using the following command:

<pre>
rake xapit:index
</pre>

However, this requires that the application be restarted for it to read the new database.  The upstream developer of the Xapit plugin is working on improving this.
